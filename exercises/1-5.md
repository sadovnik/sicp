# Exercise 1.5
Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:
```racket
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
        (if (= x 0) 0 y))
```
Then he evaluates the expression
```racket
(test 0 (p))
```
What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

## Answer
Applicative-order will produce and infinite recursion by calling `(p)`.
Normal-order will return `0` evaluating like this:
```racket
(test 0 (p))

(if (= x 0) 0 y) #| to evaluate whole if expression need to evaluate x |#

(if (= 0 0) 0 y) #| now we can evaluate it |#

(if #t 0 y)

0
```
