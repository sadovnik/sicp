# Excercise 1-15
Exercise 1.15.  The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation sin x ~ x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity `sin r = 3 * sin(r/3) - 4 * sin^3(r/3)` to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```racket
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a.  How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?

b.  What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

## Answer
a. Let's use substitution principle to figure it out:
```
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
```

So, the answer is **4**.

b. Let's say `n` is number of `p` procedure is called when argument is equal `h`. If we want to get `n + 1` calls than we need to multiply the argument by 3. If we want to get `n + 2` than by `3^2`. The common correlation between argument and number of `p` calls is following: for `h * 3^k` argument we get `n + k` calls. Another words, for linear growth of `p` calls there must be exponential growth of argument. Thus, order of growth of `sine` is logarithmic `Î˜(log n)`.
