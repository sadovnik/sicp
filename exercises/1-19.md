# Exercise 1-19

Solution was fully invented by Sergey Koziniy. I didn't figured it out myself.

Lets calcualate a1, b1 and a2, b2:

![a1, b1 and a2, b2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/15fu3yndc3xietm/system.png?dl=1)

This looks much like an equation system. This means we can express a2 and b2 via a0 and b0 if we substitute a1 and b2 with their definition.
The final equations will have following form:

![a2 and b2 with q' and p'](https://www.dropbox.com/s/41vocz17etoxl93/q_p.png?dl=1)

So the whole deal is to group the result so it match this form.

Let's calcualate:

Ta-da! The answer is:
```
q' = q^2 + 2pq
p' = q^2 + p^2
```

Also, [this is how it looks in the `fib` procedure](https://github.com/sadovnik/sicp/blob/master/exercises/1-19.rkt#L18-L19).
